    name: Securing a Legacy Invoice Import Service
    description: >
      In this proof-of-concept security module, you will act as a junior software
      engineer tasked with fixing a critical vulnerability in a legacy invoice
      import service. The service currently evaluates user-provided expressions
      using Python's eval(), exposing it to code injection attacks.
      
      Your goal is to safely parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions containing
      Roman numerals and integers while rejecting malicious or malformed input.
